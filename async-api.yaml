  description: >
    WebSockets API offers real-time data updates. WebSockets is a bidirectional
    protocol offering fastest real-time data, helping you build real-time
    applications.


    ### General Considerations


    - All messages sent and received via WebSockets are encoded in JSON format.
    
    - All message are sent in the socket.io channel name: message (Except for the chat channel).
    
    - For chat messages, the rescuer and call center will have their own channel name: messageCallCenter and messageRescuer.
